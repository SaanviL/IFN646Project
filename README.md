# IFN646 - COVID-19 Gene Expression and CRISPR Guide Design Project 
# (Group 9)

# This project aims to identify genes with significantly lower expression in COVID-19 patients and design suitable CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) sequences to potentially restore the deregulated gene expression. The project involves multiple stages, from analyzing RNA-seq data to evaluating CRISPR gRNA designs across different human genomes.


# Introduction
# The primary goal of this project is to identify downregulated genes in COVID-19 patients and use CRISPR technology to modulate their expression. The project is divided into three key tasks:

# Task 1: Analyze RNA-seq data to find significantly downregulated genes using differential expression tools.
# Task 2: Design gRNAs for CRISPRa/CRISPRi to target the identified genes and regulate their expression.
# Task 3: Assess gRNA suitability across different human genomes by checking for off-target effects using variant data.

# This README provides an overview of the data, tasks, and instructions on how to run the analysis.


# Data
# The data required for this project includes RNA-seq raw counts, human genome sequences, annotations, and variant information.
