# IFN646 - COVID-19 Gene Expression and CRISPR Guide Design Project (Group 9)

# Introduction
This project aims to identify genes with significantly lower expression in COVID-19 patients and design suitable CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) sequences to potentially restore the deregulated gene expression. The project involves multiple stages, from analyzing RNA-seq data to evaluating CRISPR gRNA designs across different human genomes.

This README provides an overview of the data and instructions on how to run the analysis.

# Tools
DESeq2 and edgeR

# Data
The data required for this project includes RNA-seq raw counts, human genome sequences, annotations, and variant information.
