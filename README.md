# IFN646 - COVID-19 Gene Expression and CRISPR Guide Design Project (Group 9)

# Introduction
This project aims to identify genes with significantly lower expression in COVID-19 patients and design suitable CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) sequences to potentially restore the deregulated gene expression. The project involves multiple stages, from analyzing RNA-seq data to evaluating CRISPR gRNA designs across different human genomes.

The primary goal of this project is to identify downregulated genes in COVID-19 patients and use CRISPR technology to modulate their expression. The project is divided into three key tasks:

Analyze RNA-seq data to find significantly downregulated genes using differential expression tools.

Design gRNAs for CRISPRa/CRISPRi to target the identified genes and regulate their expression.

Assess gRNA suitability across different human genomes by checking for off-target effects using variant data.


This README provides an overview of the data and instructions on how to run the analysis.


# Data
The data required for this project includes RNA-seq raw counts, human genome sequences, annotations, and variant information.
